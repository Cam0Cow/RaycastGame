#Raycast Game

##Overview

* This repository contains the code for a game inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, using very similar rendering technology.
* This is a school project: the code will be suboptimal and at times even wrong.
* This repository will serve for the development of the project over the next few months.
* More information will be added to the README detailing internal operation of the game as things are implemented.
